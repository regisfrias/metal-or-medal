<h1>Faqe (fake FAQ)</h1>

<p>Questions no one asked, but I'm pretty sure someone is wondering.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>What's with the horrific piano?</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The point here is to see if you are able to recognize a music genre based solely on the notes. In the cases presented here the arrangement is the key difference between the two. The piano sound is the equivalent of putting a mask to the singer whose identity you want to find out. Besides the songs are generated in real time, so they are as only as pretty as a player piano can do.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>Why would someone create such a silly game?</dfn></dt>
  <dd>I like metal and I like classical music. Some people don't understand how these two facts can be possible at the same time. This silly game is here to show them how.</dd>
